# Fallqs' Compiler Proj

This project is far from perfect. In fact, its development faced collossal difficulty and made me went through a rockyroad.

However, the tiring and exhausting experience ended up with a not-so-bad result -- it compiles fast ASMs.

Part of the reasons why including the implementation of SSA, MCS-based Register distribution and SCC-heuristic dead code elimination.

It is a pity that auto-inline was not implemented, leaving a bit meaningless jump commands that decrease executing speed.
